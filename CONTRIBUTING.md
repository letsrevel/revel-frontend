## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please check our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/letsrevel/revel-frontend/issues) first to see if it's already been reported.

**To report a new bug:**

## üìù Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch naming conventions:**

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/event-rsvp`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/mobile-button-click`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/api-client`)
- `docs/` - Documentation changes (e.g., `docs/contributing`)
- `test/` - Test additions or fixes (e.g., `test/event-component`)

### Writing Code

**IMPORTANT:** Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidelines.

**Key principles:**

1. **TypeScript strict mode** - All code must be fully typed
2. **Svelte 5 Runes** - Use modern Svelte 5 syntax (`$state`, `$derived`, etc.)
3. **Mobile-first design** - Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
4. **Accessibility first** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is mandatory
5. **Test your code** - Write unit, integration, or E2E tests as appropriate

**Before writing code:**

- Understand the existing codebase structure
- Check if similar functionality exists
- Consider accessibility implications
- Think about mobile UX
- Consult the Svelte MCP for Svelte 5 best practices

### Code Style

We enforce code quality with automated tools:

- **ESLint:** Linting (`pnpm lint`)
- **Prettier:** Formatting (`pnpm format`)
- **TypeScript:** Type checking (`pnpm check`)

**Run before committing:**

```bash
pnpm check && pnpm lint && pnpm format && pnpm test
```

**Style guidelines:**

- Use `const` over `let` when possible
- Prefer descriptive names over short ones
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use TypeScript types, avoid `any`
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Accessibility Requirements

**Every contribution must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards:**

- ‚úÖ **Keyboard navigation:** All interactive elements must work with keyboard
- ‚úÖ **Screen reader support:** Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- ‚úÖ **Color contrast:** Minimum 4.5:1 for text
- ‚úÖ **Focus indicators:** Visible focus states on all focusable elements
- ‚úÖ **Alt text:** All images must have descriptive alt attributes
- ‚úÖ **Responsive:** Works on all screen sizes

**Test accessibility:**

1. Navigate your feature using only the keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape)
2. Use a screen reader (VoiceOver on macOS, NVDA on Windows)
3. Check color contrast with browser DevTools
4. Test on mobile device or mobile viewport
5. Run Lighthouse accessibility audit

### Testing

**We require tests for:**

- New features
- Bug fixes (add a regression test)
- Public API changes

**Types of tests:**

1. **Unit tests** (Vitest) - Pure functions, utilities, stores

   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

2. **Component tests** (@testing-library/svelte) - Component behavior

   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

3. **E2E tests** (Playwright) - Critical user journeys
   ```bash
   pnpm test:e2e
   ```

**Writing good tests:**

- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, timers)
- Test accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA)

### Committing Changes

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear commit history:

**Format:**

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Build process, dependencies, tooling

**Examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(events): add RSVP confirmation modal"
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve token refresh loop on logout"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

**Commit guidelines:**

- Keep commits focused (one logical change per commit)
- Write clear, descriptive messages
- Reference issues when applicable: `fixes #123`

### Pushing and Creating a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch:**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Give it a clear, descriptive title
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`)
   - Add screenshots/videos for UI changes
   - Mark as draft if work-in-progress

3. **PR Description should include:**
   - What changed and why
   - How to test the changes
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Screenshots/videos (for UI changes)
   - Any breaking changes
   - Any new dependencies

**Example PR description:**

```markdown
## What Changed

Added RSVP confirmation modal to event detail pages.

## Why

Users were confused about whether their RSVP was submitted successfully.
This modal provides clear feedback.

## Testing

1. Navigate to any event detail page
2. Click "RSVP to Event"
3. Verify modal appears with confirmation message
4. Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
5. Test on mobile viewport

## Accessibility

- Modal traps focus (keyboard accessible)
- Escape key closes modal
- ARIA labels added for screen readers
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA

## Screenshots

[Include screenshots]

Closes #42
```

### Code Review Process

All PRs require review before merging:

1. **Automated checks must pass:**
   - Type checking (`pnpm check`)
   - Linting (`pnpm lint`)
   - Tests (`pnpm test`)
   - Build (`pnpm build`)

2. **Maintainer review:**
   - Code quality and style
   - Test coverage
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Performance implications

3. **Feedback:**
   - Address review comments
   - Push new commits (don't force-push during review)
   - Respond to questions

4. **Approval and merge:**
   - Maintainer will merge when approved
   - Delete your branch after merge
