## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Known Issues
1. **Dashboard needs major enhancement** - Currently minimal
2. **Mobile optimization needed** - Some features not fully mobile-optimized
3. **Test coverage gaps** - Many features lack tests (~65% coverage)
4. **Landing page is basic** - Needs proper hero, featured events
5. **No query key factory** - TanStack Query could be better organized

### Completed Improvements
- Authentication token refresh now automatic
- Potluck permissions properly implemented
- Modal z-index issues fixed
- RSVP flow fully reactive

### Recommended Refactors
1. **Create query key factory** - Better TanStack Query organization
2. **Extract common patterns** - RSVP/ticket purchase flows share logic
3. **Optimize bundle size** - Currently at 95KB, lazy load heavy components
4. **Standardize forms** - Create reusable form patterns
5. **Add error boundaries** - Better error isolation
