## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items:
1. **API Client Generation (#1)** - If this fails, everything blocks
   - *Mitigation:* Test early with backend team, have fallback plan

2. **Stripe Integration (#16)** - Payment processing is critical
   - *Mitigation:* Use Stripe test mode, thorough error handling

3. **Questionnaire Builder (#23)** - Complex drag-and-drop UI
   - *Mitigation:* Break into smaller tasks, consider simpler MVP

### Medium Risk Items:
1. **QR Code Scanning (#22)** - Requires camera access
   - *Mitigation:* Manual entry fallback, test across devices

2. **Real-time Features** - Potluck, check-in updates
   - *Mitigation:* Polling fallback, optimize refetch intervals

### Low Risk Items:
- Most CRUD operations
- Static pages and layouts
- Documentation

## Subagent Usage Recommendations

For specific tasks, leverage the specialized Claude Code subagents:

- **#1-6 (Foundation):** Use `api-sync` subagent for API client
- **#9, #3 (Components/Layouts):** Use `component-creator` subagent
- **#7, #8, #10-14 (Routes):** Use `route-creator` subagent
- **#28 (E2E Tests):** Use `testing-helper` subagent
- **#30 (Accessibility):** Use `accessibility-checker` subagent
- **Planning new features:** Use `project-manager` subagent

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for building the Revel Frontend from scratch. With 35 well-defined issues organized across 6 phases, the project has a solid foundation for success.

**Key Takeaways:**
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of all features
- ✅ Clear dependencies and critical path
- ✅ Realistic time estimates (518-614 hours base)
- ✅ Strong focus on quality (accessibility, testing, performance)
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies in place

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Start with Phase 0 (Foundation) - no shortcuts
2. Move methodically through phases
3. Don't skip testing or accessibility
4. Review and adjust estimates as you learn
5. Use subagents for specialized tasks

The backend is ready. Let's build an exceptional frontend! 🚀
